  		<p>The Guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept instructions to pay Direct Debits.</p>
		<p>If there are any changes to the amount, date or frequency of your Direct Debit GOV.UK Pay will notify you (normally 3 working days) in advance of your account being debited or as otherwise agreed. If you request GOV.UK Pay to collect a payment, confirmation of the amount and date will be given to you at the time of the request.</p>
		<p>If an error is made in the payment of your Direct Debit, by GOV.UK Pay or your bank or building society, you are entitled to a full and immediate refund of the amount paid from your bank or building society.</p>
		<p>If you receive a refund you are not entitled to, you must pay it back when GOV.UK Pay asks you to.</p>
		<p>You can cancel a Direct Debit at any time by simply contacting your bank or building society. Written confirmation may be required. Please also notify GOV.UK Pay.</p>
